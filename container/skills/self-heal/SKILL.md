# Self-Heal: IPC Error Triage

When you see a message starting with `[IPC Error]`, follow this triage process.

## Error Categories

### `unknown_ipc_type` — Unknown IPC Type

The host has no handler registered for the IPC type you used.

**Check first:** Did you make a typo or use the wrong type name? Common mistakes:
- `schedule_tasks` instead of `schedule_task`
- `google_home` instead of `google_assistant_command`

**If your mistake:** Correct the type name and retry the IPC call.

**If the type matches a known CLI tool or skill:** The handler registration is broken on the host side. This is a host-side bug — the skill that provides this handler likely forgot to import its IPC handler module.

### `handler_error` — Handler Exception

The host handler exists but crashed while processing your request. This is always a host-side bug.

### `malformed_request` / `invalid_request` — Bad Request (reserved)

These error codes are defined but not currently emitted by the host. If you see them in the future, it means your IPC request had malformed JSON or missing required fields — fix the request and retry.

## Bug Report Flow

When you identify a host-side bug (`unknown_ipc_type` that isn't your typo, or `handler_error`):

1. Write a bug report to `/workspace/group/feature-requests/` with filename `bug-<short-description>.md`
2. Include:
   - **Title:** `bug: <description>`
   - **IPC type** that failed
   - **Error message** from the `[IPC Error]` notification
   - **What you were trying to do** (the user's request that led to this)
   - **Steps to reproduce** (the exact IPC call you made)
3. Inform the user that the command failed due to a host-side bug and that you've filed a report

## Important

- Do NOT retry more than once for the same error — if it fails twice, it's a bug, not a transient issue
- Do NOT suppress the error from the user — always inform them what happened
- If a CLI tool timed out (60s), check if an `[IPC Error]` arrived — the error notification explains why
