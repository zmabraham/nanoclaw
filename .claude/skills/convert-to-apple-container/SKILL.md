Use when the user wants Apple Container instead of Docker, or is setting up on macOS and prefers the native runtime.

# Convert to Apple Container

This skill switches NanoClaw's container runtime from Docker to Apple Container (macOS-only). It uses the skills engine for deterministic code changes, then walks through verification.

**What this changes:**
- Container runtime binary: `docker` → `container`
- Mount syntax: `-v path:path:ro` → `--mount type=bind,source=...,target=...,readonly`
- Startup check: `docker info` → `container system status` (with auto-start)
- Orphan detection: `docker ps --filter` → `container ls --format json`
- Build script default: `docker` → `container`
- Dockerfile entrypoint: `.env` shadowing via `mount --bind` inside the container (Apple Container only supports directory mounts, not file mounts like Docker's `/dev/null` overlay)
- Container runner: main-group containers start as root for `mount --bind`, then drop privileges via `setpriv`

**What stays the same:**
- Mount security/allowlist validation
- All exported interfaces and IPC protocol
- Non-main container behavior (still uses `--user` flag)
- All other functionality

## Prerequisites

Verify Apple Container is installed:

```bash
container --version && echo "Apple Container ready" || echo "Install Apple Container first"
```

If not installed:
- Download from https://github.com/apple/container/releases
- Install the `.pkg` file
- Verify: `container --version`

Apple Container requires macOS. It does not work on Linux.

## Phase 1: Pre-flight

### Check if already applied

```bash
grep "CONTAINER_RUNTIME_BIN" src/container-runtime.ts
```

If it already shows `'container'`, the runtime is already Apple Container. Skip to Phase 4.

## Phase 2: Apply Code Changes

### Ensure upstream remote

```bash
git remote -v
```

If `upstream` is missing, add it:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/qwibitai/nanoclaw.git
```

### Merge the skill branch

```bash
git fetch upstream skill/apple-container
git merge upstream/skill/apple-container
```

This merges in:
- `src/container-runtime.ts` — Apple Container implementation (replaces Docker)
- `src/container-runtime.test.ts` — Apple Container-specific tests
- `src/container-runner.ts` — .env shadow mount fix and privilege dropping
- `container/Dockerfile` — entrypoint that shadows .env via `mount --bind`
- `container/build.sh` — default runtime set to `container`

If the merge reports conflicts, resolve them by reading the conflicted files and understanding the intent of both sides.

### Validate code changes

```bash
npm test
npm run build
```

All tests must pass and build must be clean before proceeding.

## Phase 3: Credential proxy network binding

Apple Container uses a bridge network (bridge100) that only exists while containers are running. The credential proxy must start before any container, so it cannot bind to the bridge IP. It must bind to `0.0.0.0`, which exposes port 3001 on all network interfaces — anyone on your local network could route API requests through the proxy using your credentials.

Use AskUserQuestion to ask the user:

**"The credential proxy needs to bind to all interfaces (0.0.0.0). Is this Mac on a trusted private network?"**

Options:
1. **Yes, private/home network** — description: "No firewall rule needed."
2. **No, shared/public network** — description: "Add a macOS firewall rule to block external access to port 3001."

For both options, add `CREDENTIAL_PROXY_HOST=0.0.0.0` to `.env`:

```bash
grep -q 'CREDENTIAL_PROXY_HOST' .env 2>/dev/null || echo 'CREDENTIAL_PROXY_HOST=0.0.0.0' >> .env
```

If they chose the public network option, set up and persist the firewall rule:

```bash
echo "block in on en0 proto tcp to any port 3001" | sudo pfctl -ef -
```

```bash
grep -q 'nanoclaw proxy' /etc/pf.conf 2>/dev/null || echo '# nanoclaw proxy — block LAN access to credential proxy
block in on en0 proto tcp to any port 3001' | sudo tee -a /etc/pf.conf > /dev/null
```

Verify the rule is working:

```bash
curl -sf http://$(ipconfig getifaddr en0):3001 && echo "EXPOSED — rule not working" || echo "BLOCKED — rule active"
```

If the verification shows "EXPOSED", warn the user and retry. If "BLOCKED", confirm success and continue.

## Phase 4: Verify

### Ensure Apple Container runtime is running

```bash
container system status || container system start
```

### Build the container image

```bash
./container/build.sh
```

### Test basic execution

```bash
echo '{}' | container run -i --entrypoint /bin/echo nanoclaw-agent:latest "Container OK"
```

### Test readonly mounts

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/test-ro && echo "test" > /tmp/test-ro/file.txt
container run --rm --entrypoint /bin/bash \
  --mount type=bind,source=/tmp/test-ro,target=/test,readonly \
  nanoclaw-agent:latest \
  -c "cat /test/file.txt && touch /test/new.txt 2>&1 || echo 'Write blocked (expected)'"
rm -rf /tmp/test-ro
```

Expected: Read succeeds, write fails with "Read-only file system".

### Test read-write mounts

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/test-rw
container run --rm --entrypoint /bin/bash \
  -v /tmp/test-rw:/test \
  nanoclaw-agent:latest \
  -c "echo 'test write' > /test/new.txt && cat /test/new.txt"
cat /tmp/test-rw/new.txt && rm -rf /tmp/test-rw
```

Expected: Both operations succeed.

### Full integration test

```bash
npm run build
launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.nanoclaw
```

## Troubleshooting

**Apple Container not found:**
- Download from https://github.com/apple/container/releases
- Install the `.pkg` file
- Verify: `container --version`

**Runtime won't start:**
```bash
container system start
container system status
```

**Image build fails:**
```bash
# Clean rebuild — Apple Container caches aggressively
container builder stop && container builder rm && container builder start
./container/build.sh
```

**Container can't write to mounted directories:**
Check directory permissions on the host. The container runs as uid 1000.

## Summary of Changed Files

| File | Type of Change |
|------|----------------|
| `src/container-runtime.ts` | Full replacement — Docker → Apple Container API |
| `src/container-runtime.test.ts` | Full replacement — tests for Apple Container behavior |
| `src/container-runner.ts` | .env shadow mount removed, main containers start as root with privilege drop |
| `container/Dockerfile` | Entrypoint: `mount --bind` for .env shadowing, `setpriv` privilege drop |
| `container/build.sh` | Default runtime: `docker` → `container` |
